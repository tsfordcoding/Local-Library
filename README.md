# Instructions to Download and Run Project Locally

1. Download program files from Github either by downloading zip folder or through another means provided by Github.
2. Run `npm install` in Local Library folder to download node modules needed to run program.
3. Run `npm start` to run program locally.

# Project description: Local library

Your neighborhood has decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. One of the most important features needed to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available, which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program.

Other people are taking care of the logistics and design, but they need you to build the algorithms.

## Learning objectives

This project is designed to test your ability to work with large datasets and build algorithms based on those datasets. You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project. Before taking on this project, you should be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below:

  - Using Visual Studio Code as a text editor

  - Differentiating between the three most common JavaScript error types

  - Solving bugs by using error messages

  - Differentiating between `let`, `const`, and `var`, and using each appropriately

  - Creating an array from a string based on particular criteria and joining arrays into strings

  - Writing strings that embed expressions using template literals

  - Accessing all the values and keys of an object

  - Using `find()`, `filter()`, `map()`, `some()`, and `every()` to solve different problems

  - Using `reduce()` to solve different problems

  - Using `sort()` to sort arrays in various ways

This is the first major project to go over basic JavaScript program fundamentals as part of the Thinkful/Chegg Skills Software Engineering program.
